This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r}
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2023-10-17')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# plot(pressure)
```
